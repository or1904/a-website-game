THE EXPERIMENT

Hello! i am @or1904 and this is one of my first serious games i have done so far. 
This is an undertale fun game, totally free from cost, coded with HTML, CSS and js.

* This is an old project so i wouldnt make updates or bug fixes if there are any, but please let me know if there are.
* Not all of the drawings and actually all of the music is not made by me, if you are gona use the music or the drawings please contant the creators first. This is basically a school project so i am sorry for any hurm or copyright issues. 
intro music by KillyKid
text sound by Toby Fox 
background remix music by SharaX
the rest is also Toby Fox.
the drawings i didnt make were taking randomly from the internet, sorry but i didnt see who made them.
* The rules are not written, the player (you) should figure them out by himself.
* To play the game, download the whole file, then open the first html file in it which called "FINAL".

Please leave your honest review on my game!
